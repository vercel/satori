## API

Satori translates the layout and styles of HTML & CSS based elements into an SVG image.

```jsx
import satori from 'satori'

satori(
  <div style={{ color: 'black' }}>hello, world</div>,
  {
    width: 600,
    height: 400,
    fonts: [
      {
        name: 'Roboto',
        data: robotoArrayBuffer,
        weight: 400,
        style: 'normal',
      },
      ...
    ],
    embedFont: true,   // Embed the font in SVG as path data. Optional, default: true.
    debug: false,      // Show the bounding box for debugging. Optional, default: false.
    graphemeImages: {} // Custom grapheme images. Optional, default: empty.
  },
)
```

Which yields:

```js
'<svg ...><path d="..." fill="black"></path></svg>'
```

Text (with font data) will be embedded in the SVG as paths.

## Documentation

### JSX

Satori only accepts JSX elements that are pure and stateless. You can use a subset of HTML
elements (see section below), or custom React components, but React APIs such as `useState` and
`useEffect` are not supported.

#### Use without JSX

If you don't have JSX transpiler enabled, you can simply pass [React-elements-like objects](https://reactjs.org/docs/introducing-jsx.html) that have `type`, `props.children` and `props.style` (and other properties too) directly:

```js
satori(
  {
    type: 'div',
    props: {
      children: 'hello, world',
      style: { color: 'black' },
    },
  },
  options
)
```

### HTML Elements

Satori supports a limited subset of HTML and CSS features, due to its special use cases. In general, only these static and visible elements and properties that are implemented. 

For example, the `<input>` HTML element, the `cursor` CSS property are not in consideration. And you can't use `<style>` tags or external resources via `<link>` or `<script>`.

Also, Satori does not guarantee that the SVG will 100% match the browser-rendered HTML output since Satori implements its own layout engine based on the [SVG 1.1 spec](https://www.w3.org/TR/SVG11).

You can find the list of supported HTML elements and their preset styles [here](https://github.com/vercel/satori/blob/main/src/handler/presets.ts).

#### Images

You can use `<img>` to embed images but `src`, `width`, and `height` attributes are all required.

```jsx
satori(
  <img src="https://picsum.photos/200/300" width={200} height={300} />,
  options
)
```

When using `background-image`, the image will be stretched to fit the element by default if you don't specify the size.

If you want to render the generated SVG to another image format such as PNG, it would be better to use base64 encoded image data directly as `props.src` so no extra I/O is needed.

#### Emojis

To render custom images for specific graphemes, you can use `graphemeImages` option to map the grapheme to an image source:

```jsx
satori(
  <div>Next.js is ðŸ¤¯!</div>,
  {
    ...,
    graphemeImages: {
      'ðŸ¤¯': 'https://twemoji.maxcdn.com/v/13.1.0/svg/1f92f.svg',
    },
  }
)
```

The image will be resized to the current font-size (both width and height), so it must be a square.

## Contribute

This project uses [pnpm](https://pnpm.io). To install dependencies, run:

```bash
pnpm install
```

To start the playground locally, run:

```bash
cd playground
pnpm dev
```

And visit localhost:3000/test.

To start the development mode, run `pnpm dev` in the root directory (can be used together with the playground to view it in live).

To start and live-watch the tests, run:

```bash
pnpm dev:test
```
